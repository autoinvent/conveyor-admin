# Conveyor Admin: CDN

This example shows a basic implementation of Conveyor and Conveyor Admin loaded from a CDN. This example uses a vanilla vite server to run the app as well as loading React as a CDN. The server is currently set up to proxy the Magql endpoint to `http://localhost:5000`.
Choose an example Magql backend to use from [autoinvent/magql](https://github.com/autoinvent/magql/tree/main/examples) or feel free to set one up yourself!

## Setup
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173 to see Conveyor Admin and have control over the data.
